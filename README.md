# Usage and Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. 

You can use this as the base of your music player and extend. Or you can just use as it is, fix some issues and change theme for a different look. The only requirement is you reference this repository as the base of your project. That shouldn't be a big deal, right?
